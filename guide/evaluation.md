# Evaluation Guide

Use this page to evaluate whether EvalScope Benchmark MCP fits a real workflow.

## What To Test

- AI SDK benchmark dashboard
- EvalScope Benchmark MCP
- EvalScope Benchmark MCP documentation
- EvalScope Benchmark MCP remote MCP
- evalscopebench server card

## Expected Evidence

- Open EvalScope Benchmark MCP and select the buyer plan.
- Create or request a bearer token from the hosted product.
- Add https://evalscopebench.clauxel.com/mcp to a compatible MCP client.
- Run tools/list, then call run_benchmark_gate with public-safe sample data.
- Save the returned receipt or export for human review.

## Risk Checks

- Do not put API keys, tokens, payment details, private logs, or customer records in public issues.
- Use public-safe sample data for examples and directory submissions.
- Treat generated receipts and scores as reviewer evidence, not as a substitute for accountable human approval.
